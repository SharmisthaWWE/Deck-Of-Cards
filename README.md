# Deck Of Cards

# Description
ETSChallenge is Java project where the “Deck of Cards” problem is solved. In order to solve this problem, two classes are implemented.

DeckOfCardsAssignment.java - DeckOfCardsAssignment class contains the implementation of 3 tasks. They are, the creation of 52 cards, shuffling the cards and dealing a card from the deck.

CreateCard.java - This is a helper class that is used to create the 52 cards systematically. This class contains two Java Enum for four suits and face values. These two Enums are used to create the 52 cards

In order to solve this problem, I have used Java as a programming language and Gradle build system.
